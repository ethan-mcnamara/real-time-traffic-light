manager deciding if the cars move or stop
	- while loop
		- check traffic control
		- for first 8 
			- if green - moveCars
			- else - stopCars
		- for the rest
			- keep moving

traffic control
	- while loop
		- use queue with each of green, amber, red
		- take top of queue as current light
			- send signal to that light
		- delay for what potentiometer says (different for amber? red/green?)
		- push to bottom of queue
			- stop current light

potentiometer reader
	- read from pc3
	- use value to generate delay between 1-2 seconds?

moveCars
	- move each led to the right
	- use list of 1/0's
  		- randomly generate first value based on potentiometer value
		- iterate each value in list and set it to the previous value

stopCars
	-
